a jekyll theme used for my own repositories' github pages. heavily based (mostly copied from) my [main website](https://andythepie.github.io). i have no clue what i'm doing...


## installation

add add this line to your repository's `_config.yml`:

```yaml
remote_theme: AndyThePie/jekyll-theme
```

## usage

you should probably overwrite `_sass/colors.scss` and define your own variables (`$emphasis` and `$background`.)

## contributing

if you have any issues (bugs, annoyances, etc.) please file an issue.

while you are free to make suggestions, please note that this theme is primarily for my own use, and that i'm also very lazy. if you wish to make a pull request, please open an issue beforehand (or reply to a pre-existing issue). thanks!

and also be nice to others.
